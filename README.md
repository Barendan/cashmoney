This is my Portfolio
(link coming soon)

The page is broken up into two sections:
-Intro Section
-Main Content

The intro section displays the links to all social media websites I am a part of, allows you to sample my taste in music, and even check out my repository on GitHub which allows you to see all of my work(that I've made public). 

The main content portion of the page displays a menu on the left that contains links to sections on the right. The first section lists some of the skills that I am able to provide. The second section contains a demo of those mentioned skills. You will find a sample of the projects I have worked on. The third and final section is simply eye candy and displays pictures of some of the beautiful sights I have had the fortune to see. 

Hope you enjoy the site!
